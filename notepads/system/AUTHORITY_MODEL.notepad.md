# Authority Model — Atlas Wealth

## Purpose
This notepad explains how authority is defined and enforced within Atlas Wealth.

## Core Rule
Authority is singular, human-bound, and non-delegable.

AI systems and agents do not possess authority.

## Authority Holder
Final authority is exercised by a licensed human adviser whose identity is bound
via cryptographic signing and immutable event records.

## Enforcement Mechanisms
- Signed commits
- Draft vs Commit separation
- Immutable event streams
- Evidence pack anchoring

## Regulatory Alignment
This model is designed to satisfy ASIC RG 255 / RG 277 and AFSL accountability
requirements.

This document is explanatory only and confers no authority.
