# Ã°Å¸Å¡â‚¬ Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Continuous Advice & Learning Loop

**Tag:** v6.8.0  |  **Status:** Frozen (execution remains gated)

---

## Ã°Å¸â€Â§ Overview

Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 completes the end-to-end continuous advice lifecycle with a governed, non-executing self-learning loop.


This release establishes Atlas Wealth as the **decision-of-record and evidence-of-record** for financial advice, while keeping all execution paths explicitly disabled and gated.

## Ã¢Å“â€¦ What's New

### Ã°Å¸â€”Â­ Living Client Financial State
- Canonical client financial state model
- Source tagging (Xplan / Bank / Broker / Manual)
- Freshness tracking for continuous advice

### Ã°Å¸â€œÂ¸ Deterministic Drift Detection
- Threshold-based drift detection
- Explicit reasons and affected accounts
- No ML or opaque logic

### Ã°Å¸â€”Â  Advice Validity Engine
- Advice classified as VALID / STALE / INVALID
- Deterministic rules (state drift + age)
- Human-readable explanations

### Ã°Å¸â€œÂ³ Adviser Workflow (Read-only)
- Single workflow surface showing:
  - client state
  - drift status
  - advice validity
  - required next actions
- No execution controls

### Ã°Å¸â€˜Â¡ Client Acceptance (incl. Partial)
- Accept / Reject / Defer
- Partial acceptance by recommendation
- Mandatory rationale capture
- Immutable acceptance evidence

### Ã°Å¸â€™Â§ Advice Ã¢â€ â€™ Intent Binding (Non-executing)
- Accepted advice creates ELIGIBLE intent objects
- Intents reference advice + acceptance
- Execution remains disabled

### Ã°Å¸â€”Â  Learning Signal Capture
- Append-only capture of:
  - advice validity transitions
  - client acceptance outcomes
  - (future) compliance outcomes
- PII-minimal and tenant-isolated

### Ã°Å¸ÂÂ§ Offline Model Training Pipeline (Governed)
- Batch-only training pipeline
- Feature extraction from learning signals
- Evaluation harness
- Model registry with approval gating
- No auto-deployment

### Ã°Å¸â€ºÂ¡ Compliance Review Ingestion
- Structured ingestion of:
  - PASS / REWORK / FAIL
  - rework counts
  - missing sections
  - inserted clauses
  - reviewer reason codes
- Feeds learning and governance

## Ã°Å¸Ââ€™ Explicit Non-Goals (By Design)
- Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Trade execution
- Ã¢ÂÂ  Banking or broker live calls
- Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Automated model updates
- Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Advice auto-approval
- Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Client financial ledger replacement

> **Execution remains fully gated by ceremony and policy.**

### Ã°Å¸Å’â€° Governance & Regulatory Posture
- Deterministic advice logic
- Evidence-first architecture
- Replayable decision history
- Human approval at all critical points

This release aligns with regulator expectations around reasonable basis, process discipline, and auditability.

### Ã°Å¸ÂÅ  Recommended Next Steps
- Treat v6.8.0 as the reference architecture
- Use for board review and regulator briefings
- Defer execution enablement until pilot outcomes are validated
