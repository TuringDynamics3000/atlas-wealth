# ðŸš€ Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 â€“ Continuous Advice & Learning Loop

**Tag:** v6.8.0  |  **Status:** Frozen (execution remains gated)

---

## ðŸ”§ Overview

Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 completes the end-to-end continuous advice lifecycle with a governed, non-executing self-learning loop.


This release establishes Atlas Wealth as the **decision-of-record and evidence-of-record** for financial advice, while keeping all execution paths explicitly disabled and gated.

## âœ… What's New

### ðŸ—­ Living Client Financial State
- Canonical client financial state model
- Source tagging (Xplan / Bank / Broker / Manual)
- Freshness tracking for continuous advice

### ðŸ“¸ Deterministic Drift Detection

- Explicit reasons and affected accounts
- No ML or opaque logic

### ðŸ—  Advice Validity Engine
- Advice classified as VALID / STALE / INVALID
- Deterministic rules (state drift + age)
- Human-readable explanations

### ðŸ“³ Adviser Workflow (Read-only)
- Single workflow surface showing:
  - client state
  - drift status
  - advice validity
  - required next actions
- No execution controls

### ðŸ‘¡ Client Acceptance (incl. Partial)
- Accept / Reject / Defer
- Partial acceptance by recommendation
- Mandatory rationale capture
- Immutable acceptance evidence

### ðŸ’§ Advice â†’ Intent Binding (Non-executing)
- Accepted advice creates ELIGIBLE intent objects
- Intents reference advice + acceptance
- Execution remains disabled

### ðŸ—  Learning Signal Capture
- Append-only capture of:
  - advice validity transitions
  - client acceptance outcomes
  - (future) compliance outcomes
- PII-minimal and tenant-isolated

### ðŸ§ Offline Model Training Pipeline (Governed)
- Batch-only training pipeline
- Feature extraction from learning signals
- Evaluation harness
- Model registry with approval gating
- No auto-deployment

### ðŸ›¡ Compliance Review Ingestion
- Structured ingestion of:
  - PASS / REWORK / FAIL

## ðŸ’ Explicit Non-Goals (By Design)
- â¤ Trade execution
- â  Banking or broker live calls
- â¤ Automated model updates
- â¤ Advice auto-approval
- â¤ Client financial ledger replacement

> **Execution remains fully gated by ceremony and policy.**

### ðŸŒ‰ Governance & Regulatory Posture
- Deterministic advice logic
- Evidence-first architecture
- Replayable decision history
- Human approval at all critical points

This release aligns with regulator expectations around reasonable basis, process discipline, and auditability.
