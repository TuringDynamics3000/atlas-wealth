# 🚀 Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 – Continuous Advice & Learning Loop

**Tag:** v6.8.0  |  **Status:** Frozen (execution remains gated)

---

## 🔧 Overview

Atlas Wealth v6.8.0 completes the end-to-end continuous advice lifecycle with a governed, non-executing self-learning loop.


This release establishes Atlas Wealth as the **decision-of-record and evidence-of-record** for financial advice, while keeping all execution paths explicitly disabled and gated.

- Freshness tracking for continuous advice

### 📸 Deterministic Drift Detection
- Threshold-based drift detection
- Explicit reasons and affected accounts
- No ML or opaque logic

### 🗠 Advice Validity Engine

- Human-readable explanations

### 📳 Adviser Workflow (Read-only)
- Single workflow surface showing:

  - drift status
  - advice validity
  - required next actions
- No execution controls

### 👡 Client Acceptance (incl. Partial)
- Accept / Reject / Defer
- Partial acceptance by recommendation
- Mandatory rationale capture
- Immutable acceptance evidence

### 💧 Advice → Intent Binding (Non-executing)
- Accepted advice creates ELIGIBLE intent objects
- Intents reference advice + acceptance
- Execution remains disabled

### 🗠 Learning Signal Capture
- Append-only capture of:
  - advice validity transitions
  - client acceptance outcomes
  - (future) compliance outcomes
- PII-minimal and tenant-isolated

### 🏧 Offline Model Training Pipeline (Governed)
- Batch-only training pipeline

## 🐒 Explicit Non-Goals (By Design)
- ❤ Trade execution
- ❠ Banking or broker live calls
- ❤ Automated model updates
- ❤ Advice auto-approval
- ❤ Client financial ledger replacement

> **Execution remains fully gated by ceremony and policy.**

### 🌉 Governance & Regulatory Posture
- Deterministic advice logic
