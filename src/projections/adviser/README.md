# Adviser Projection Contracts (LOCKED)

These interfaces define the **canonical, production-grade
read models** for Atlas Wealth adviser workflows.

Rules:
- Projections are read-only
- Derived solely from events
- Deterministic and replayable
- Authority-aware
- Breaking changes require governance approval

UI, APIs, evidence, and replay tooling MUST conform to these
contracts. Not the other way around.
